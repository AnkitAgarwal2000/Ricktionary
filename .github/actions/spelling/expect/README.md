The contents of each `.txt` file in this directory are merged together.

| File                              | Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [expect](expect.txt)              | is the main list of expected items -- that are just some variables names you can't change |
| [plantuml](plantuml.txt)          | plantuml syntax keywords                                                                  |
| [ui exceptions](uiexceptions.txt) | the words that have to be exempted because... its easy to change var names with an IDE    |
| [web](web.txt)                    | is a sample for web/html related items                                                    |

These terms are things which temporarily exist in the project, but which
aren't necessarily words.

If something is a word that could come and go, it probably belongs in a
[dictionary](../dictionary/README.md).
