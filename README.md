# Ricktionary

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

The repository is divided into 3 modules

- [Resources](#Resources)
- [Server](#Server)
- [Client](#Client)

## Ricktionary Sub-Modules:

1.  ### Resources

This module will contain the `LevelImage` class (you know, the object containing the image data, image answer, and other stuff that Client/Server can use)
[Server](#Server) & [Client](#Client) are dependent on this module

2.  ### Server

This module will contain the code for Server app, its unit-tests and other relevant server stuff

Compiled `jar` for the Server app will be available here.

3.  ### Client

This module will contain the code for Client app, its unit tests and other stuff.
The compiled `jar` for the Client app will be available in this directory (or published via a Release, idk, will figure it out)

## Stuff to keep in mind:

- Always pull before you start editing code
- **DO NOT DIRECTLY COMMIT TO `main` BRANCH**
- We'll be doing the development work on the `development` branch and `main` will be used to mark significant releases. \
  When your respective work is done, open a Pull Request from your branch to `development` branch.

  **(This is the way how to avoid merge conflicts unlike [last time](https://github.com/TeamRocketBalleBalle/RICA/commits/main))**
